I came to Delhi and SBT during my childhood as I was spending half of my time in the streets and roaming around aimlessly. Today, I am a tour guide in the City Walk programme, doing my Bachelor's degree and also looking after the After Care Programme of SBT. I am keen on Drama and Performing Arts.</p>

So for my well-being, I was sent to the Arushi Home of Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi when I was five years old. I got a lot of love and care from the people working for the organisation and SBT has now become my family. I learned a lot of things and was mentored to turn my dreams into reality. I started as a peer educator at one of the Contact Points and then joined the City Walk programme in August 2015. I recently enrolled for higher education. I am doing an air hostess course at Franfinn Institute, Delhi.</p>

I have learnt a lot from this programme and loved meeting new people at the Walk every day. I completed my graduation in Political Science and now working as an intern at the Parliament House.</p>

                            <p>I am 25 years old. I ran away in 2003 from my home in Assam since it was unbearable for me to see my father fighting over small things. My father and my elder brother used to beat me often. I was a lost child when I got off the train at the New Delhi Railway Station. SBT provided me with a meaningful direction and I could see my life in a new light. I joined the City Walk programme in 2013 which allowed me to improve my language skills. I am in the final year of my graduation and also pursuing a PG Diploma course in Tourism from Kuoni Travel Academy. Currently, I am also working as a freelancer with a travel agency in Delhi.</p>

                            <p>I am 25 years old. I am from a small village near Agra, Uttar Pradesh. I ran away from home when I was six years old because my father used to beat my mother over small things. When I arrived at the New Delhi Railway Station, life was more difficult than I ever expected. One day, I met a social worker from Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi who convinced me to join the Trust. After coming to SBT in 2006, my life changed for good - I got enrolled in a school and partake in activities of my choice, like theatre. I joined the City Walk programme in 2012 as I wanted to become more confident by improving my English communication skills. Today, I have completed my graduation and even applied for a job in the U.S.</p>

                            <p>I am 26 years old. I hail from the Ghaziabad district in Uttar Pradesh. I lived in a joint family. My father has a life-threatening disease which unfortunately changed our lives forever. My father approached an NGO that helped us in giving medical aid to him and referred me to Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi. I came here in 2004 and it has provided me with a promising environment where I was able to shape my personality. I joined the City Walk programme in 2013 as I was very keen to learn the English language. After completing high school, I am currently pursuing a degree in Tourism from IGNOU, and also doing a regular Diploma in Tourism Management from Kouni Academy, Delhi. Presently, I am planning to set up my own business.</p>

                            <p>I am 23 years old. I am originally from Bihar. My father is a Maulvi (priest in a mosque) who wanted me to become just like him but I was not interested. Tired of my father's beatings, I ran away and took a train to New Delhi. I worked in a lock shop near the New Delhi Railway Station. One day I met a man who told me about an NGO, Don Bosco Ashalayam. I went there and felt very happy. My father came to know where I was and he took me back home. He told me that I must study the Quran and become a Maulvi. I left my home again and came back to New Delhi. I met a social worker of Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi in 2012 who told me about the organisation and the facilities provided by them. I joined the City Walk programme in 2013 because I wanted to improve my English communication skills and become a confident person. Life is a big challenge but I am excited to face it. I am currently working as an intern in a travel agency and completing my graduation.</p>

                            <p>I am 24 years old. I was born in Mumbai. When I was two years old, my father died in an accident. After that, I started living with my mother and younger sister near the Mumbai Railway Station. Later, my mother also died when I was ten years old and we were sent to the hostel of Saint Anthony High School. After two years, I met the Family Service Centre, an adoption centre that helped me and my sister find a suitable adoption family; we were sent to live in Boston in the U.S. with my new family. However, I was unable to adjust to the lifestyle there and after two years, I came back to Mumbai. Since 2010, I have been living in the Girls Home of SBT. The Home has helped me a lot by providing many facilities, especially education. I joined the City Walk programme in 2014 because I want to improve my English communication skills and become more confident. Presently, I am studying in class 10 via an open school and working as a receptionist.</p>

From 2006 to 2009, I sensitised more than 6000 people from across the world about street children and their lives. Those three years entirely changed my life. My English speaking, reading, and writing skills improved, and I even created a Walk anthem. I was able to take one step further towards my aim - I am pursuing graduation from IGNOU and working at a call centre. I also want to study in the U.S. to become a professional tour guide.</p>

I lived on the streets for more than two years until an SBT staff convinced me to go and live in their shelter home. I studied sociology through distance education and joined the City Walk programme in 2006. It is in this programme that I met an American girl with whom I fell in love, and who is now my wife! We married in 2010 and live together in Atlanta. Presently, I am pursuing my higher education at a university here in the U.S.</p>

                            <p>I am originally from Bihar. I ran away from my home at the age of six, owing to the regular verbal and physical violence I faced from my aunt. Besides badmouthing and beating me, she used to engage me in household and petty work. Devoid of a regular childhood, I soon got lost on the streets of Delhi. I spent five years collecting garbage and selling refilled water bottles. One day, I was found by an SBT staff and joined them thereafter. I finished school while in SBT and also learned Spanish. I was a City Walk guide from 2008 until September 2010, when I left to study Tourism Management in the USA on a scholarship. I came back in June 2011 and presently, I am working in a reputed travel agency. I hope to start my travel agency soon.</p>

                            <p>I am 30 years old. I spent my childhood in a railway community area which is very close to the New Delhi Railway Station. When I was 17 years old, I used to be a very rude and restless boy. I used to smoke, drink alcohol, and wander around the streets all night with my friends. That time, my mother brought me to the Akanksha Contact Point of SBT, where I met the coordinator and other SBT staff who counselled me to become a better person. Thereafter, I started studying and became curious about learning English. This motivated me to join the City Walk programme in 2009 and worked as a guide for a year. I learned many things about my personality and skills, passed high school, and enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National University to pursue my graduation. Besides this, I am working for the Indian Railways as a technician and constantly working to improve my skills.</p>

                            <p>I am from Bihar. I ran away at the age of seven to pursue education, recognising that I couldn't study there due to limited opportunities in my village. I followed a friend who had earlier been to Delhi but got separated from him on the way and ended up at the New Delhi Railway Station alone. Luckily, I knew the name of Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi and had heard of the educational opportunities there. I found the Trust and decided to stay there, even though my parents came to Delhi to take me home. I was part of the City Walk programme from 2008 until September 2010 to improve my English, and achieved a lot! I completed my graduation from Delhi University and am a successful Karate coach for Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi and other schools in Delhi. I plan to do a Master's in Social Work as I am very much interested in contributing to society.</p>

                            <p>I am 28 years old. I ran away from my home in Bihar when I was seven because my family was very poor and we didn't have enough food. I lived on the streets and at railway stations, mainly in New Delhi, for about eight years. I survived by collecting leftover food from luxury trains, polishing shoes, selling water bottles, and rag picking. When I was about 14, a Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi staff met me and counselled me to join the Trust; eventually, I joined their shelter home and participated in various activities while studying through the National Open School. I became involved with City Walk in 2006 to improve my English and worked as a guide for some time. I also did a lot of crafts work (macramÃ©) and trained many people too. I have a Bachelor's degree and also completed my post-graduation. I am currently helping to set up a Volunteer Flat for SBT in Paharganj.</p>

                            <p>I am 30 years old. I am from Bihar and I came to Delhi with my father when I was six years old to work in a factory. After working for 15 months, I got lost at the New Delhi Railway Station while searching for my brother. All alone on the streets, I fell prey to a local gang that engaged me in activities like pick-pocketing, stealing and buying drugs. One day, two SBT social workers spotted me and brought me to one of the shelter homes where I stayed for 12 years and received my education. SBT also helped me find my parents and reunite with them. At SBT, I was involved in many activities - as a Walk guide, actor, puppeteer and stage light designer while also pursuing Bachelor's in Arts. I worked in the City Walk programme for two years until July 2011, when I went to the USA on a scholarship to study Business Management in Wisconsin. I came back in May 2012 and plan to set up my own business. I am very thankful to Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi for positively changing my life and helping me realise my dreams!</p>

One day, I was so badly beaten by my father that I made a plan and ran away. I spent one night at the Old Delhi Railway Station where I struggled for food and a place to sleep and was beaten up by the police many times. The next day, a social worker from SBT found me and I started living and studying in one of the shelter homes. After completing high school, I worked as a guide in City Walk for two years until June 2012 when I got selected for a U.S scholarship to study Information Technology at the City College of San Francisco. I came back in 2013 and pursued a Degree course in Animation and Web Designing.</p>

I don't clearly remember my parents or my hometown but I still shiver when I recall the nights spent alone, in hunger and fear, on the trains and at train stations, many times being beaten up by the police and older people who also lived on the streets. In 2006, I joined SBT where I learnt computers from a reputed institute in Delhi and completed high school through an Open School. In 2010, I joined the City Walk Programme as I wanted to improve my communication skills, interact with people from different countries and learn from their cultures. Since the time I joined City Walk, I developed an interest in the Travel industry. I completed a Diploma course in Tourism from Kuoni Travel Academy, and currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration (BBA) through a Distance Education Programme via a CQU scholarship. In 2014, I also got selected, through the U.S scholarship, to study a Certificate course in Business Management from Miami Dade College, USA. Now I live independently and want to work for other street children, and support a shelter home like the one I grew up in.</p>

I joined the City Walk programme in 2011 as I used to be a very shy person and did not like to talk in front of other people.

When I was 12 years old, I decided to run away from home. I arrived in Delhi but didn't know where to go or what to do in this city.

Then one day I met a social worker from Salaam Baalak Delhi Trust who encouraged me to join one of the shelter homes. I joined SBT in 2005 and my life changed for the better.

                            <p>I am from Bihar. As a child, I used to take care of the goats in my home village and did not attend regular school as it was far from my home. My older brother ran away when he was 11 years old and was already living at Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi (SBT). One day, he came back home and asked my father if he could take me to SBT because I wanted to study and my parents could not afford that. My parents are not educated but they understood the value of education and so they agreed. When I arrived in Delhi, I was 8 years old and remember being shocked because I had never seen such big buildings or crowds before. My brother took me to SBT straight away so unlike most of the other children there, I never spent any time living on the streets. Because I was a village boy from Bihar, I could not speak any Hindi and was quite shy, and missed my family a lot. After some months, however, I attended the 5th class at a regular school and learnt Hindi, Maths, and English. This made me feel a lot happier as I could interact with other children. Currently, I have completed a six-month course in basic computers and multimedia. I joined the City Walk team in 2012 because I wanted to improve my English communication skills and gain confidence. I have also done a Diploma course in Tourism from Kuoni Travel Academy and also pursuing a degree in Tourism through a Distance Education Programme via a CQU scholarship. In 2014, I was selected through a U.S scholarship to study a certificate course in Tourism Management from Miami Dade College, USA.</p>
